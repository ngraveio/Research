# Research
This repository contains a collection of research papers and blockchain proposals related to common blockchain problems.
Together, these documents reflect the ongoing research and development efforts of the Ngrave team and their contributions to the advancement of the crypto blockchain space.

## Blockchain Commons

We have based our work for this section on the research conducted by [Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research). Specifically, we are referencing and expanding upon the UR type definitions discussed within their research.

Here we provide multiple new UR types that are designed to be used in conjunction with the UR types defined by Blockchain Commons. These new UR types are designed to be used by wallets that support multiple coins and multiple accounts within those coins.

## Blockchain Commons Papers

### BCR Number

Please number all Ngrave Blockchain Research BCRs with a four-digit number representing the current year (`YYYY`) followed by a three-digit sequence number for that year (`SSS`). For example: `nbcr-2020-001` is the first BCR for 2020, `nbcr-2020-017` is the 17th, and `nbcr-2021-001` is the first BCR for 2021.

_Note that the sequence number reverts to 001 at the start of each year._

To prevent confusion between research papers that may have the same ID within the Blockchain Commons Research papers, we have added the letter n as a prefix to each paper's ID within our repository
### BCR Title

Please be sure that your title is concise, yet informative.
